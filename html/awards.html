	<h3>Team-voted Awards</h3>
	<h5 style="font-style: italic">3 nominees determined by the team captain(s). Winner chosen by team vote.  Awards were not handed out in the 2008-2009 season.</h4>
	<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Mark Garibotto Award</B></FONT> - Team MVP in the regular season<BR>
	2011-2012: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=736">Rob Lewis</A><br>
	<blockquote>Playing in all 20 games, leading the team in goals, points, and game winning goals, was more than enough to get Rob his third Garibotto award</blockquote><br>
	2010-2011: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=1007">Brad Miller</A> & <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=1153&G=1">Cory Waldron</A><br>

	2007-2008: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=736">Rob Lewis</A><br>
	2006-2007: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=499">Brian Hurh</A><br>
	<blockquote>This was Brian's third consecutive year winning this award - and it was much deserved. As evidenced in the payoffs, we were never as strong as we where when Brian was on the ice. Just like past two years - play, his hustle, and his leadership were an inspiration to us all.</blockquote><br>
	2005-2006: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=499">Brian Hurh</A><br>
	<blockquote>This was by far the most contested award on this year's ballot. Shaun and Brian were neck-and-neck until the very end. And Pat wasn't far behind. But in the end, Brian's leadership, hustle, and unselfish play made him very deserving of his second consecutive Garibotto Award.</blockquote><br>
	2004-2005: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=499">Brian Hurh</A><br>
	<blockquote>Any one of the nominees could have won this award. Don, as always, was a force throughout the season. And Jon was a stalwart on defense. But it was Brian who deservedly wins the award, racking up a personal best 26 points and scoring many, many clutch goals.</blockquote><br>
	2003-2004: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=379">Don Smith</A><br>
	2002-2003: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=315">Jon Perkins</A>
	</P>

	<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Don Hill Award</B></FONT> - Playoff MVP (including league championships in Toronto when appropriate)<BR>
	2011-2012: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=1299">Dan Benson</A><br>
	<blockquote>Dan led the team with 3 goals and 4 points in his first playoffs.</blockquote><br>
	2010-2011: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=1154">Chris Deutsch</A> & <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=1153&G=1">Cory Waldron</A><br>

	2008-2009: N/A<br>
	2007-2008: N/A<br>
	2006-2007: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=736">Rob Lewis</A><br>
	<blockquote>Just like the regular season, Rob was the leading team point getter in the playoffs. His ability to put the puck in the back of the net was key in getting us to the playoffs and the second round. We couldn't have done it without him.</blockquote><br>
	2005-2006: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=428">Shaun Markley</A><br>
	<blockquote>Talk about clutch! During the playoffs, Shaun had four of the five game winning playoff goals - and he was getting clobbered the entire time! Along with Brian and Larry, Shaun's line was truly the most potent in Invaders history.</blockquote><br>
	2004-2005: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=499">Brian Hurh</A><br>
	<blockquote>Brian continued his fantastic play into the Playoffs, leading perhaps the most potent line in Invaders history. Linemate Dave "The Ninja" Kashihara was brilliant among the way and goalie Pat Courter was stellar in the first two games, allowing only 1 goal per game.</blockquote><br>
	2003-2004: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=525">Gavin Grossman</A><br>
	2002-2003: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=289&G=1">Don Hill</A>
	</P>
	
	<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Rob Singer Award</B></FONT> - Most Valuable Defenseman<BR>
	2011-2012: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=733">Lexie Lewis</A><br>
	<blockquote>Lexie led all defensemen in points, with 16, for his third straight Singer award, and fourth in all.</blockquote><br>
	2010-2011: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=733">Lexie Lewis</A><br>
	2009-2010: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=733">Lexie Lewis</A><br>
	2008-2009: N/A<br>
	2007-2008: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=734">Forrest Wilder</A><br>
	2006-2007: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=733">Lexie Lewis</A><br>
	<blockquote>I'm not sure how Lexie will feel when he reads this, but when I watched the 2007 Stanley Cup Playoffs and saw Rob Neidermeyer, it actually reminded me a little bit of Lexie on the ice for the Invaders. One word comes to mind: dominating - both with the puck and without it.</blockquote><br>
	2005-2006: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=285">Amit Saha</A><br>
	<blockquote>It's a familiar sound. First a stick hits the ice on a slap shot. And then, soon after, the sound of the puck bouncing off Amit's padding (hopefully not bone!). It's too bad there isn't a league statistician because there was no way that ANYONE came close to Amit when it came to throwing his body out to block a shot. Tack on his tenacity and unwillingness to be satisfied with his own play and you have someone very deserving of the team's most valuable defensemen award.</blockquote><br>
	2004-2005: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=505">Jon Schwarzter</A><br>
	<blockquote>Jon was a defensive leader the whole season, shutting down teams and scoring with his blistering slap-shot. Few would dispute his claim to this award.</blockquote><br>
	2003-2004: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=411">Alex Beuzelin</A><br>
	2002-2003: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=396">Rob Singer</A>
	</P>

	<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Whitey Award</B></FONT> - Best Defensive Forward<BR>
	2011-2012: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=1232">Ryan Larrance</A><br>
	2010-2011: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=499">Brian Hurh</A><br>

	2008-2009: N/A<br>

	2006-2007: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=735">Pat Winter</A><br>
	<blockquote>I can't think of a guy that's more deserving of this award - and the votes showed it. No one was faster in getting back defensively and more willing to take on a defensive role than Pat. He was the clear winner for this award. I relinquish my hold on this one!</blockquote><br>
	2005-2006: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=316">Justin &quot;Whitey&quot; Herzog</A><br>
	<blockquote>It's my fourth year winning this award and I greatly appreciate it, though I'm not entirely sure I'm deserving. Brian was great in hustling to get back and Bram was a BULL when he got his feet going. I feel that either of these guys could have won this one.</blockquote><br>
	2004-2005: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=316">Justin &quot;Whitey&quot; Herzog</A><br>
	<blockquote>It's my third year winning this award and I greatly appreciate it. Chris Baxter's "new legs" in getting back were amazing at times, though. And Mike Laing, probably one of the best skaters on the team and a true forward to boot, was a fantastic in playing defense when needed.</blockquote><br>
	2003-2004: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=316">Justin &quot;Whitey&quot; Herzog</A><br>

	<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Rookie of the Year Award</B></FONT><BR>
	2011-2012: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=1299">Dan Benson</A><br>
	<blockquote>Dan played both forward and defense this season and was great at both (and lucked out a little that we only had one rookie this year).</blockquote><br>
	2010-2011: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=1231">Matt Gill</A><br>
	</P>

	<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Bram Kadonoff Award</B></FONT> - Player who puts forth the most effort game after game regardless of individual stats<BR>
	2011-2012: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=498">Steve Lustbader</A><br>
	2010-2011: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=688">Steve Lefferts</A><br>
	2009-2010: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=549">Keith Shepherd</A><br>
	2008-2009: N/A<br>
	2007-2008: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=285">Amit Saha</A><br>
	2006-2007: (tie) <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=688">Steve Lefferts</A> &amp; <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=285">Amit Saha</A><br>
	<blockquote>Steve has come a long way since joining the team last summer. While he may not be a specialist out on the ice, it's tough to deny that he doesn't give his all  - no matter where he's placed. As for Amit (and I say this every year), if they kept stats on blocked shots, I don't think there would be anyone in the LEAGUE who would come near him. That says a LOT!</blockquote><br>
	2005-2006: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=411">Alex Beuzelin</A><br>
	<blockquote>One guy who really showed his heart this season was Alex. Skating hard on every shift and giving it all while battling in the corners where trademarks of Alex's play throughout the year. Steve and Dave were great at times in their hustle for loose pucks as well.</blockquote><br>
	2004-2005: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=550">Ben Slocum</A><br>
	<blockquote>Ben, an Invaders rookie that had rarely played D before joining us, picked up the position like he had always played there. And the intensity in his eyes and in his play proved him to be a deserving winner of this award.</blockquote><br>
	2003-2004: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=16">Bram Kadonoff</A><br>
	2002-2003: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=16">Bram Kadonoff</A>

	<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Lady Gardiner Award</B></FONT> - The player who most exerts sportsmanship combined with gentlemanly conduct<BR>
	2011-2012: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=549">Keith Shepherd</A><br>
	<blockquote>A second consecutive Lady Gardiner award is a fitting way to close out the career of one of the least penalized Invaders ever.</blockquote><br>
	2010-2011: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=549">Keith Shepherd</A><br>
	2009-2010: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=428">Shaun Markley</A><br>
	2008-2009: N/A<br>
	2007-2008: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=498">Steve Lustbader</A><br>
	2006-2007: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=734">Forrest Wilder</A><br>
	<blockquote>Big Forrest was an incredible asset to the team this year. On the ice, he embodied the phrase &quot;speak softly and carry a big stick, you will go far.&quot; I don't think Forrest ever had an opportunity to receive a penalty - simply because his sweeping stick kept pucks no where near an opponent's body. And in a year where penalties hurt us immensely, this was greatly appreciated.</blockquote><br>
	2005-2006: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=564">Dave Kashihara</A><br>
	<blockquote>I can't think of a nicer guy out on the ice than Dave. But that's not a knock against his play in any way. Dave truly exemplified the spirit of fair play - all the while skating hard and battling for the puck.</blockquote><br>
	2004-2005: (tie) <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=285">Amit Saha</A> &amp; <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=379">Don Smith</A><br>
	<blockquote>Amit's physical, while at the same time very clean play is something that we all could learn from. And it's been over a year since we've seen Don take a penalty (AMAZING!)</blockquote><br>
	2003-2004: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=499">Brian Hurh</A><br>
	2002-2003: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=189&G=1">Pat Courter</A>
	</P>

	<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Courter Award</B></FONT> - Player who best exemplifies the qualities of perseverance, sportsmanship and dedication to the sport (exerts the most determination to play hockey despite adversity)<BR>
	2011-2012: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=736">Rob Lewis</A><br>
	<blockquote>Rob didn't miss a game, despite attending law school and coming all the way from Baltimore.</blockquote><br>
	2010-2011: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=1154">Chris Deutsch</A><br>
	2009-2010: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=498">Steve Lustbader</A><br>
	2008-2009: N/A<br>
	2007-2008: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=189&G=1">Pat Courter</A><br>
	2006-2007: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=189&G=1">Pat Courter</A><br>
	<blockquote>One thing I know about Pat - you can count on him to show. This quality deserves an immense amount of respect and is something greatly appreciated in a goalie. Throw on the fact that he lives the furthest from the rinks AND has a daughter - that's dedication. Only Mike Laing has played in more Invader games.</blockquote><br>
	2005-2006: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=189&G=1">Pat Courter</A><br>
	<blockquote>The only player to give me a call at 4am in the morning to let me know he wasn't going to make a game! Pat's major surgery and willingness to make every game he could - despite intense pain at times - was an inspiration to us all. And I don't think anyone sacrificed more of his time to improve his game - playing in many pick-up games at ridiculous times. This is Pat's second consecutive year winning this award.</blockquote><br>
	2004-2005: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=189&G=1">Pat Courter</A><br>
	<blockquote>Pat was the exemplification of this award this season. He attended EVERY game, played in more pick-ups than ANY of us, and was always trying to get better. It showed. Pat ended the season with an 87% save percentage and 2 shutouts - both Invader records.</blockquote><br>
	2003-2004: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=285">Amit Saha</A><br>

	2011-2012: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=1230">Ben Shakelton</A><br>

	2006-2007: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=427">Brendan Hart</A><br>
	<blockquote>Brendan, who up until this year was strictly a summer Invader, handled the transition to the pressure of winter with ease. His line of himself, Markley, and Winter showed itself to be especially potent as years of playing together paid off.</blockquote><br>
	2005-2006: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=16">Bram Kadonoff</A><br>
	<blockquote>Virtually everyone attempted to give their all on every shift this year - but NO ONE did it as consistently and as aggressively as Bram. As soon as Bram lowered his head, everyone knew to expect a hard forecheck in the corner or an amazing effort on the backcheck. In the five years that Bram has been playing with the Invaders this was by far his best season - and EVERYONE wanted him on their line.</blockquote><br>
	2004-2005: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=498">Steve Lustbader</A><br>
	<blockquote>Where did THIS guy come from? Steve discovered a fire under his a** this season, skating stronger than ever and putting the puck in the net.</blockquote><br>

	2006-2007: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=291">Jon Sambur</A><br>
	<blockquote>Uncle Jon provided many niceties to many of us following games. Thanks, Jon. (Next year, we really need to step up on this award. This team needs more drunkards.)</blockquote><br>
	2005-2006: <A HREF="/roster/default.asp?ID=529">Larry Posciak</A><br>
	<blockquote>&quot;Our Team! Red Hot! Big Balls!&quot; Larry followed up his Drunken Hat-Trick of last year with and amazing and drunk performance at the Verizon Center. And I believe there were many, many other events during the course of the season that made Larry a deserving winner of the award.</blockquote><br>

	<blockquote>The most prestigious award for an Invader to win, Larry did it with class. In an 11-2 drubbing of the Vikings, Larry was credited with a hat-trick while completely hammered. And he didn't even throw up. THAT is Varsity, BABY!</blockquote><br>
